### Project Description
CropGuard is a farmer-centric website that integrates AI to revolutionize agricultural support. It offers crop disease detection through image analysis, real-time weather alerts,
daily crop price updates, and intelligent chatbot support to address farmers' queries. Additionally, AI-driven insights power detailed soil analysis reports, helping farmers make smarter decisions.
The app supports three languages for broader accessibility.

### The Problem statement
Farmers face significant challenges such as timely identification of crop diseases, unpredictable weather conditions, fluctuating crop prices, and a lack of easily accessible expert guidance.
Limited availability of comprehensive, localized, and multilingual technological solutions further exacerbates these issues.

### The Solution
CropGuard aims to address these challenges by integrating AI to provide disease detection through image analysis, real-time weather alerts, daily crop prices, an intelligent agro chatbot,
and detailed soil reports, empowering farmers with actionable insights and informed decision-making.
